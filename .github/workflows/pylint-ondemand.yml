#  C0301 (line-too-long): Some lines (URLs, long string literals, complex type hints, FQL queries) are more readable when kept intact rather than
#    artificially wrapped. Modern wide monitors and horizontal scrolling make this less a personal preference.
#  R0801 (duplicate-code): Similar lines across files are often unavoidable in policy grading logic where each policy type follows similar patterns
#    but with type-specific variations. The structural similarity is intentional for consistency and maintainability.
#  C0411 (wrong-import-order): Import ordering can conflict with formatter tools (black, isort) and doesn't affect functionality. Team consistency
#    via automated formatters takes precedence over pylint's preferences.
#  C0413 (wrong-import-position): Used intentionally for conditional imports (e.g., TYPE_CHECKING guards, optional dependencies) and module-level
#    initialization that must occur before imports.
#  C0415 (import-outside-toplevel): Lazy imports inside functions/methods are deliberately used to:
#    * Break circular import dependencies
#    * Improve startup time by deferring expensive imports
#    * Load optional dependencies only when needed
#  W0613 (unused-argument): Common in interface implementations, abstract method overrides, active development and callback signatures where the
#    signature must match but not all parameters are used in every implementation.
